## Introduction

you will create a Progressive Web Application (PWA). A PWA is a web application with native-like capabilities that can be installed and used on any device, which makes 
it a popular solution for mobile users. “Native-like capabilities” means that PWAs act much like a standalone, native application even though they are actually web 
applications.

## User Story

standards.

## Acceptance Criteria

It is done when I can view key performance metrics of a PWA and key diagnostics.
